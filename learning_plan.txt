Week 1: Introduction to LlamaIndex and Basic Concepts
Goal: Familiarize yourself with the core concepts and architecture of LlamaIndex.
Day 1: Overview of LlamaIndex

Read the official documentation or introduction blog posts.
Understand the motivation behind using LlamaIndex (data retrieval, RAG, indexing).
Key concepts: indexing, retrieval, connectors, large language models (LLMs).
Day 2: Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Study RAG and why it’s important for enhancing LLM capabilities.
Watch a few videos or read tutorials explaining RAG and how LlamaIndex fits in.
Explore the difference between RAG and standard language model inference.
Day 3: Setting Up Your Environment

Install LlamaIndex and any dependencies (Python, OpenAI API keys, etc.).
Set up a simple Python project that uses LlamaIndex and OpenAI’s GPT models.
Run a basic example from the documentation to ensure your setup is correct.
Day 4-5: Creating Basic Indexes

Learn how to create a basic document index.
Key topics: chunking data, document parsing, embedding-based retrieval.
Explore different index types: list index, tree index, and keyword index.
Write Python code to index a few documents and retrieve them with queries.
Day 6-7: Hands-on Exercises

Index a dataset of your choice (e.g., articles, books, PDFs).
Run queries against your dataset to retrieve relevant information.
Experiment with retrieval quality and index performance.
Week 2: Advanced Indexing & Data Integration
Goal: Learn how to integrate and index complex or structured data using connectors and custom pipelines.
Day 1: Exploring Data Connectors

Learn about data connectors (e.g., Google Drive, Notion, SQL, APIs).
Study how to use connectors to pull data from different sources.
Implement a connector-based example (e.g., pull data from Google Drive or a CSV file).
Day 2: Structured Data Integration

Learn how to integrate structured data like databases or spreadsheets.
Build an index from a SQL database or a CSV with structured data.
Practice querying structured data and retrieving insights using LlamaIndex.
Day 3-4: Customizing Indexing

Learn to customize how data is indexed (e.g., chunk size, embedding model).
Experiment with different chunking strategies for large documents.
Try using alternative models (e.g., LLaMA, Anthropic’s Claude) for indexing and retrieval.
Day 5-6: Memory and Persistent Knowledge Bases

Learn how to maintain persistent memory with LlamaIndex (e.g., session-based knowledge augmentation).
Build an application that remembers user interactions across sessions by storing conversations or retrieved data in an index.
Day 7: Hands-on Project: Building a Search Engine

Build a basic search engine using LlamaIndex and an open-source dataset (e.g., Wikipedia articles, blog posts).
Incorporate both unstructured (text) and structured (tables) data.
Focus on fine-tuning retrieval and improving search performance.
Week 3: Query Processing and Custom Pipelines
Goal: Understand how to customize query workflows, synthesize complex queries, and use LlamaIndex for specific tasks like summarization.
Day 1: Query Processing and Filtering

Learn about query synthesis, customization, and filtering.
Study how queries are transformed and matched with relevant indexed data.
Write a custom query handler that modifies how queries are interpreted or matched.
Day 2-3: Multi-Document and Complex Query Handling

Learn how to handle multi-document queries and aggregations.
Build a pipeline that retrieves information from multiple documents and synthesizes a coherent answer.
Day 4-5: Summarization

Implement document summarization using LlamaIndex.
Learn about hierarchical summarization (chunk-based) and how it works in LlamaIndex.
Apply summarization to a dataset of long documents and evaluate the output.
Day 6: Entity and Data Extraction

Implement a pipeline to extract specific entities or data from documents.
Explore how to configure LlamaIndex to retrieve very specific pieces of information, such as names, dates, or keywords.
Day 7: Hands-on Project: Knowledge Base System

Build a dynamic knowledge base system using LlamaIndex.
Allow the system to ingest and summarize documents, extract entities, and handle user queries in real time.
Week 4: Scaling, Optimization, and Real-World Applications
Goal: Explore advanced techniques for scaling LlamaIndex, optimizing performance, and building real-world applications.
Day 1: Scaling LlamaIndex

Learn how to scale indexing and retrieval for large datasets.
Study memory optimization, parallelization, and distributed indexing.
Implement indexing for a large dataset (e.g., thousands of documents).
Day 2: Performance Tuning

Learn how to tune the performance of your index (e.g., retrieval speed, memory usage).
Experiment with different models, embedding sizes, and indexing strategies to optimize for your use case.
Day 3-4: Tool and API Integration

Learn how to integrate LlamaIndex with APIs and external tools.
Build an application that integrates LlamaIndex with a specific API (e.g., weather API, financial API) to augment LLM answers with real-time data.
Day 5-6: Real-World Use Cases

Explore real-world use cases for LlamaIndex (e.g., chatbots, document search engines, intelligent assistants).
Work on a specific use case relevant to your interests (e.g., customer support, legal document analysis, medical information retrieval).
Day 7: Final Capstone Project

Build a full-fledged application using LlamaIndex, integrating everything you’ve learned.
Example project: A legal document analysis tool, a personalized search engine, or a chatbot that retrieves and summarizes domain-specific information.
